INTRODUCTION
This is the Codebook for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

RAW DATA
The raw data for this project can be found here:
        https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected using 
accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. More information about the
colection of this data can be found here:

Description from Data README.txt
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

Data Files from the data README.txt
The dataset includes the following files:
        - 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
        - Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

TIDY DATA
The final dataset for this project is in one file: "Second_Dataset.txt"
This dataset consists of 180 observations (rows) of 73 variables (columns).
Each row represents 1 Subject and 1 Activity. The raw data included multiple measurement observations for each Subject and Activity, so these were averaged together for the final tidy dataset. The subjectID and activityID columns are the identifiers. The Subjects range from 1 to 30 (for the subjects in the trial) and the Activities consist of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,  STANDING, and LAYING. The remaing columns of the Second_Dataset are the measurements taken from the Samsung Galaxy for each subject and activity. 
Theese measurements are:

* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z

TRANSFORMATION
To get from the Raw Data to the Tidy Data the following transformations were made. These transformations can be executed with the script ‘run_analysis.R’.

1. Merged the training and test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This is then printed out into a text file labeled "Second_Dataset.txt" into the working directory
